## **🚀 Phase 3: AI-Powered Features (12-18 months)**
🎯 **Goal:** Use AI/ML to **predict network issues**, **suggest optimizations**, and **automate decision-making** across various engineering ecosystems.

✅ **AI-Powered Insights**
- 🤖 **Bottleneck Prediction** – ML model that predicts which services might experience congestion.  
- 🔍 **Anomaly Detection** – AI-powered monitoring to detect unusual network traffic.  
- 🏗 **Automatic Policy Suggestions** – Recommend **better** Kubernetes NetworkPolicies based on traffic patterns.  
- 🧠 **AI-powered Code Analysis for Backend Engineers** – Use AI to recommend network optimizations for **API-heavy applications** and **distributed backend systems**.  

✅ **Security & Compliance**  
- 🔐 **AI-based Security Audit** – Detect misconfigured policies that expose services to attack.  
- 📊 **Compliance Reports** – Generate security compliance reports for **SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR**.  
- 🌐 **Web3 Security Visualization** – Monitor network traffic for blockchain-based applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.  

---

## **🌎 Phase 4: Enterprise & Cloud-Scale Expansion (18-24 months)**
🎯 **Goal:** Make knetvis a **go-to enterprise-grade** tool with industry-wide applications.

✅ **Web UI & Dashboards**  
- 🌐 **Standalone Web UI** – Deployable frontend for real-time network visualization.  
- 📊 **Grafana Plugin** – Export knetvis graphs into **Grafana** dashboards.  
- 📍 **Geospatial Network Maps** – Show pod-to-pod connections across **cloud regions** and decentralized networks.  

✅ **CI/CD & DevOps Integration**  
- 🏗 **GitHub Actions Integration** – Run knetvis in CI/CD pipelines to test network changes.  
- 🛡 **Pre-deployment Policy Checks** – Block risky network configurations before rollout.  
- 🔄 **Terraform Provider** – Automate network policy visualization in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.  
- 🚀 **Web3 Deployment Validations** – Ensure decentralized applications have optimized and secure network connectivity.
